Framing Example: Filling in data
================================

Running this example on the [JSON-LD Playground](http://json-ld.org/playground/index.html) produces results. The result is to filter the pathwayElements to include only those of @type gpml:Reaction and to fill in the gpml:GraphRef data for the gpml:GraphRef referenced by the gpml:Reaction.

It does not filter out gpml:Reactions with no gpml:GraphRef.
